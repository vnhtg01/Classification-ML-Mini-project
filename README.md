# Classification-ML-Mini-project

## Objective
Build a machine learning model to perform **binary classification** based on a real dataset. Project done in python on jupyter notebook.

## Pipeline Overview
1. **Data Import** : not included
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Check for missing values  
   - Analyze variable distributions  
   - Compute correlation matrix  
3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Standardization (scaling)  
   - Train/Test split  
4. **Model Training** 
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
5. **Model Evaluation** 
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Classification report  
   - Confusion matrix
6. **Model Deployment** : not included

## Notes
- Class `0` represents *healthy*, class `1` represents *sick*  

## Results
All models were trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing one for this classification task.
